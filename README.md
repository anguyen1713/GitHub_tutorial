# the main branch only contains the hello world statement

# mean_branch only contains the mean function

# the median_branch was originally just the median function, but has now been merged with the mean_branch to include the mean function
  # in the instructions, it said to merge right after adding in the median_branch, so I assumed that that was the branch the mean_branch was being added to.
